Analysis for sensory timing ensembles

Example of analysis to find neuronal ensembles that encode for time in the cortex.
First step is not shown here, uses NeuralEnsembles pipeline (https://github.com/brincolab/NeuralEnsembles) to obtain the Ensemble activity matrix

In Ensemble_pipeline.ipynb file you can find an example of how to find the neuronal ensembles and their distinct activity
